"Heads up!" analyzes files of various formats to detect oddities and errors in the data contained in the file that may cause a parser to fail. It was developed to help track down the root cause of issues file parsers. The current version can analyze ani, bmp, gif, ico, lnk, png and wav files. Though it may not cover all features of all these formats.

"Heads up!" will read a file and attempt to analyze the data and convert it to an object model that represents the information contained in the file. From this object model it creates a human readable formatted text that represents the information contained in the file, which it outputs to the screen. The code contains various checks to detect errors in the data, data that is badly formatted or violates the file format specifications or data that could cause a problem in a badly implemented parsers, it will output a warning. These warnings can often help track down the reason why a parser is failing to parse the file correctly.

Note that Heads up! is in development and does not guarantee that it will parse all files in all supported file formats correctly nor that it will detect all possible issues in data in these formats. The parsing of file formats and the checks and warnings have been implemented while investigating issues. Therefore, once the root cause of an issue was found, development of Heads up! stopped. Additional parsing, checks and warnings will be implemented as they are needed to the future.
